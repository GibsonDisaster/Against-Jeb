Please clap
I would totally kill baby hitler
Thank you all very much
To hold onto power
I, for one, am not eager
Our country is on a very bad course
What am I going to do about it
I am a candidate for president of the United States
I know we can fix this. Because I’ve done it
four percent growth
I’ll show Congress how that’s done
It is time to start making rules for the rule-makers
I will not accept it as the standard in Washington
We need a president willing to challenge and disrupt
Stuff happens
People need to work longer hours
Womens health programs are over funded
People are bringing pregnant women
We'll take care of you with free stuff
I'm a skeptic, I'm not a scientist
Immigrants are more fertile
Gay marriage is a distraction
My dad is the greatest man alive
I have put forth a vision for America
We're different in our country
Imperfect under gods watchful eye
I've seen fallible men rise up
I've had a front row seat to this
Americans test the boundaries of freedom
America is a country that thinks big
I'm proud of the campaign we've run
And to advocate conservative solutions
Reach your god given potential
Our nations bright light has began to flicker
