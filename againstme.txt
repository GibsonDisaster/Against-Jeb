Because it's us against them
And just like James, I'll be drinking Irish tonight
and the memory of his last work week will be gone forever
I was a teenage anarchist
The revolution was a lie
Evelyn I'm not coming home tonight
Well I swear to God that I'll love you forever
We're americans abroad
You call the cops on the looters and piethrowers
They call it class war, I call it co-conspirators
Cause baby I'm an anarchist and you're a spineless liberal
God damn I miss my dead friend
Does god bless your transexual heart
True Trans Soul Rebel
With your name tattoed into my skin
Because of the shame
How loooooooooooooooooow
Confessing childhood secrets of dressing up in womens clothes
Condaleeza do you get the fucking joke
Regime change under a Bush doctrine
She could hear them fucking through those thin hotel walls
Waking lifes just a living dream
Never quite the woman that she wanted to be
I'm looking for the crest of a new wave
Black me out
I don't ever want to talk that way again
I don't want to know people like that anymore
I've got fat fuckin fingers
I don't want to feel that weak and insecure
As if you're my pimp and I'm your fucking whore
All the devils that you don't know
Feeling like I need to fall down some stairs
Wanna be as close as I can get to you
They sang protest songs against military aggression
East and West could not agree
They claimed this was a war without reason
Sirens filled the air
You've got no cunt in your strut
You've got no ass to shake
You thing it's obvious that we can choose how we're made
They hold their breath just not to get your sick
IF SHE WANTS TO DANCE AND DRINK ALL NIGHT
ANXIETY ANXIETY
Grind my teeth smooth and flat in my sleep
Sometimes a party takes you places you didn't mean on going
THEY DON'T KNOW NOTHING ABOUT REDEMPTION
